# bids-brain_tumours

This repository is using BIDS specification for brain tumour imaging. This allows to exemplify how data can be stored and check that the BIDS specification has all the information to store such data (if not we can feedback to improve the BIDS specification).

## Folders

- history: contains older versions from the [ENBIT workshop](https://github.com/EN-Brain-Imaging-of-Tumours/doc)
- presentations: some relevent BIDS presentation from the [GliMR](https://glimr.eu/) annual meeting workshop
- example: 0Kb imaging files with relevant metadata

## Specification

- [imaging protocol](https://github.com/CPernet/bids-brain_tumours/blob/main/imaging_protocol.md) describes -1- a minimal imaging protocol for brain tumours and -2- advanced seqences to further specify structural, metabolique and functional areas in and around the tumour.
- [phenotype](https://github.com/CPernet/bids-brain_tumours/blob/main/phenotype.md) describes 'standard' clinical evaluations of patients.
- [dictionary](https://github.com/CPernet/bids-brain_tumours/blob/main/dictionary.md) sets the terms to be used for metadata.
