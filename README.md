This repository is a template specification for brain tumour imaging using BIDS.

## Folders

- history: contains older versions from the [ENBIT workshop](https://github.com/EN-Brain-Imaging-of-Tumours/doc)
- presentations: some relevent BIDS presentation from the [GliMR](https://glimr.eu/) annual meeting workshop

## Specification

- the [imging prtocol](https://github.com/CPernet/bids-brain_tumours/blob/main/imaging_protocol.md) describes -1- a minimal imaging protocol for brain tumours and -2- advanced seqences to further specify structural, metabolique and functional areas in and around the tumour.
