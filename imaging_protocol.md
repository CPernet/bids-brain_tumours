## Minimal structural imaging protocol

Following clinical recommendations (ref?): 
* T1w -/+ contrast enhancement (resolution 1mm^3)
* T2w (resolution 1mm^3)
* FLAIR (resolution 2mm^3 ?)
* DWI (resolution 3mm tra ?)

? 
* DSC perfusion (resolution 3-6mm tra)

If possible, anatomic images should be 3D and isotropic. In any case, there should be no gap between slices.

## Extended protocol

If the patient can tolerate it, and depending on utility for treatments, additional imaging can be gathered (need references and evidence):
* DTI for structural connectivity, the minimum number of directions is 32
* SWI / T2*
* resting state fMRI
* task fMRI - BOLD vs ASL?
* vascular response mapping (CVR) and/or hrf retrieval
* ASL

(discuss evidence for each imaging protocol)

## PET-MRI

if available, MRI can be performed before or concurently to PET - applications of simultaneous?
